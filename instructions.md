Great! Now I'll guide you through the next steps to get your Data Analyst Agent running. Here's your complete setup guide:

Step 1: Install Required Software
Install Docker
For Windows:

Go to Docker Desktop

Download Docker Desktop Installer.exe

Run the installer and follow instructions

Restart your computer when prompted

For Mac:

Go to Docker Desktop for Mac

Download Docker.dmg

Drag Docker to Applications folder

Launch Docker from Applications

For Linux:

bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
Install ngrok
For Windows:

Go to ngrok.com

Sign up for a free account

Download the Windows version

Extract ngrok.exe to a folder (like C:\ngrok\)

Add this folder to your PATH environment variable

For Mac/Linux:

bash
# Mac with Homebrew
brew install ngrok

# Linux
curl -s https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ngrok.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ngrok.asc >/dev/null
echo "deb https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com buster main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ngrok.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ngrok
Step 2: Setup ngrok Authentication
Get your auth token from ngrok dashboard

Configure ngrok:

bash
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE
Step 3: Test Your Setup
Test 1: Run Locally (Without Docker)
bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python data-analyst-agent.py
Your API should start at http://localhost:8000

Test 2: Test with Docker
bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build
Step 4: Test the API
Create a test question file:

bash
echo "Test analysis question: What is 2+2?" > questions.txt
Test with curl:

bash
# Windows (use double quotes) IN COMMAND PROMPT
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/" -F "questions.txt=@questions.txt"

# Mac/Linux
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ -F "questions.txt=@questions.txt"
Expected response: Some JSON output indicating your API is working.

Step 5: Make It Public with ngrok
In a new terminal window:

bash
# Expose port 8000 to the public
ngrok http 8000
You'll see output like:

text
Session Status                online
Account                      your-email@example.com
Version                      3.x.x
Region                       United States (us)
Latency                      32ms
Web Interface                http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding                   https://abc123.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8000
Your public URL is: https://abc123.ngrok.io

Step 6: Test Your Public API
bash
# Test the public URL
curl -X POST "https://abc123.ngrok.io/" -F "questions.txt=@questions.txt"
Step 7: Test with Real Wikipedia Example
Create a Wikipedia test file:

bash
cat > wikipedia_test.txt << EOF
Scrape the list of highest grossing films from Wikipedia. It is at the URL:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films

Answer the following questions and respond with a JSON array of strings containing the answer.

1. How many $2 bn movies were released before 2000?
2. Which is the earliest film that grossed over $1.5 bn?
3. What's the correlation between the Rank and Peak?
4. Draw a scatterplot of Rank and Peak along with a dotted red regression line through it.
   Return as a base-64 encoded data URI, "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG..." under 100,000 bytes.
EOF
Test it:

bash
curl -X POST "https://abc123.ngrok.io/" -F "questions.txt=@wikipedia_test.txt"
Step 8: Monitor and Debug
Check logs:
bash
# If running with Docker
docker-compose logs -f

# If running locally, check the terminal where you started the server
Access ngrok web interface:
Open http://127.0.0.1:4040 in your browser to see request/response details.

Common Issues and Solutions
1. Port already in use:
bash
# Kill any process on port 8000
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :8000
taskkill /PID <PID_NUMBER> /F

# Mac/Linux
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9
2. Docker build fails:
bash
# Clean Docker cache
docker system prune -a
docker-compose build --no-cache
3. ngrok authentication failed:
Double-check your auth token

Run ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN again

4. API returns 422 errors:
Check your file format (questions.txt should be plain text)

Verify multipart form data is being sent correctly

Step 9: Deploy for Submission
Once everything works locally:

Keep ngrok running (don't close the terminal)

Note your public URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io)

Create your GitHub repository:

bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Data Analyst Agent"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
git push -u origin main
Submit both URLs at the evaluation platform

Next Steps
Once you have this working, you can:

Add more sophisticated analysis logic

Integrate with real LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

Optimize for the specific evaluation criteria

Add more robust error handling
